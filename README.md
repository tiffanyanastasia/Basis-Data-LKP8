# Database Kall-O Apllication

Health has become a primary concern in today's digital era, where an active lifestyle and a balanced diet are key to maintaining quality of life. Public awareness of the importance of controlling calorie intake is increasing. Calories are essential nutrients that must be consumed, but excessive intake can lead to negative health impacts. While tracking calories may seem unnecessary to those who are less conscious about their intake, it can be a practical and valuable tool for individuals who are actively trying to manage their diet.
Busy lifestyles and limited time often cause people to neglect their daily calorie consumption. Therefore, we propose an idea to develop a platform called KallBox. KallBox is a web-based application designed to help users log and track the food they have eaten. Users can record foods they have consumed or plan to consume, along with their respective calorie values. KallBox provides both a history feature and a food library that contains calorie information, assisting users in understanding the nutritional content of their meals.
With KallBox, we aim to support individuals in taking control of their calorie intake and promote healthier living habits.
